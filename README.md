The project file on the "Secrets" web application demonstrates several core features for secure user authentication. Hereâ€™s a summary of the components based on the code structure provided:

1. **User Registration and Login**: The application allows users to register by creating accounts with an email and password. Registered users can then log in to access the app's functionalities.

2. **Data Encryption**: The app leverages the `mongoose-encryption` library to securely encrypt sensitive fields (like passwords) in the MongoDB database. A secret key, `"thisislittlesecret"`, is defined for encryption to maintain confidentiality.

3. **Routing and Templates**:
   - The app has dedicated routes (`/register`, `/login`) for handling user registration and login, respectively.
   - The views include several `.ejs` templates (e.g., `home.ejs`, `register.ejs`, `login.ejs`, `secrets.ejs`, `submit.ejs`) that render the pages users interact with.

4. **Secure Session Management**: The application uses session management through routes for login and logout, along with encrypted cookies.

5. **Secrets Sharing Feature**: Registered and logged-in users can anonymously share secrets on the platform through a "Submit a Secret" feature.

6. **Server and Port Configuration**: The Express.js server is set to listen on port `5002`.

This app illustrates a fundamental approach to web security best practices, particularly through encryption, secure session handling, and user authentication.
